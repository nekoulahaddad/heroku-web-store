## Quick Start

Make sure you set an env var for your MONGO_URI and the jwtSecret, like in the env_sample file

```bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
cd myapp
npm install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
cd ..
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
cd myapp
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```
